# Face Expression Detection: Project Documentation

## Overview
The Face Expression Detection project is designed to analyze and interpret human facial expressions in real time using computer vision and machine learning techniques. This project aims to enhance emotional awareness and promote well-being by providing immediate feedback on facial expressions.

## Features
- **Real-time Emotion Detection**: Utilizes a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for accurate emotion recognition.
- **Facial Detection**: Implements Haar cascade classifiers to detect faces in images and video streams.
- **User Feedback**: Provides immediate feedback based on emotional states detected, contributing to emotional health awareness.
- **Logging**: Captures and stores logs for debugging and performance evaluation.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - OpenCV for image processing
  - Keras and TensorFlow for deep learning
  - dlib for facial landmark detection
- **Datasets**: Utilizes datasets such as FER2013 for training the emotion recognition model.

## Installation
To set up the Face Expression Detection project, follow these steps:

### Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Face_Expression_Detection.git
cd Face_Expression_Detection
```

### Install Requirements:
Make sure you have Python installed, then install the necessary libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Run the Main Script:
Use the following command to execute the main emotion detection script:
```bash
python src/scripts/work_modal_count_and_emotion.py
```

### Capture Selfies:
The script can capture selfies and display emotion recognition in real time.

### Review Outputs:
Check the `output/` directory for:
- Saved selfies
- Logs for performance evaluation
- Results of the emotion detection
